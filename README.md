# Simple-Game-Framework
This is a simple, object oriented and lightweight framework for creating games. It is based upon raylib, but offers more features that make it even easier to create games. This is my first project, so do not take my word for granted.

## Overview
- This library is suposed to be a superset of the raylib library.
- It's s lightweight Game Engine without a graphical user interface.
- No ECS (Entity Component System) just raw object oriented power.
- Easy to use and flexible.
